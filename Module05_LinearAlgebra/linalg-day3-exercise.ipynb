In this article, Russo et al. examined neural representations in the Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) and Motor Cortex (M1) while monkeys performed a task involving cycling a hand pedal some number of times.\n",

The top PCs represent the seven cycles monkeys had to perform to accomplish the task, though SMA's representation seems to additionally reflect time or task progress.\n",

    "Now we can do PCA! Refer back to lecture to choose a way to implement this. Think carefully about what dimensionality of your input to PCA; We want to preserve the time dimension (size 5330), while reducing the dimensionality of the nueral dimension (size 77). If you're using `sklearn`, check out the documentation for `PCA.fit()` [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html#sklearn.decomposition.PCA.fit), you'll have to think about what our \"samples\" and \"features\" are. Make sure that you understand the shape of your principal components, which you can access with `.components_` after running `fit()` on an instance of `PCA()`."
