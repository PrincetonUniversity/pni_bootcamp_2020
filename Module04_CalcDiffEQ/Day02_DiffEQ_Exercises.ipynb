    "Another commmon dynamical system that's studied in neuroscience is known as the *drift-diffusion model*. The drift-diffusion model is applied to tasks involving *evidence accumulation* towards one of two available choices. One such task is known as the *towers task*, where mice run down a virtual hallway counting towers that appear to its left and right. The side with the higher number of towers by the end of the hallway corresponds to the correct choice, where if the mouse turns to the side with more towers, it will collect reward. A visualization of what this task looks like to the mouse is shown below (from Engelhard et al., 2019, *Nature*)."

However, this is *not* the full drift-diffusion model. This is more like a *drift* model; where does the *diffusion* come in? You can imagine that mice, as well as most animals, are not going to be perfect in their counting of the towers. They might get distracted and miss some, or forget how many they have seen half way through, or mistake something for a tower that didn't actually appear. To account for this, we need to add in a *diffusion* term that adds noise to the evidence accumulation. This can be done by adding a random variable drawn from a Gaussian:\n",

Because of this, when applying Euler's method, the noise term will be *excluded* from the differential function and instead added at the end.\n",
