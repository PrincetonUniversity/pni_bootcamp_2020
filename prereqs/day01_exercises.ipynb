    "The following are a set of exercises covering the basics of the python programming language. The exercises collectively require a working knowledge of basic python, including object types (floats, strings, lists), operations (addition, multiplication), control flow (if/else statements, for/while loops), core functions (len, range, sum), and custom function definitions. All the exercises should be completed without using the [python scientific stack](https://www.scipy.org/about.html) (e.g. numpy, scipy, etc) or any other imported library.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will expect a basic comfort with python for the PNI summer bootcamp. If the following exercises prove difficult to complete in a reasonable length of time (i.e. an afternoon), we encourage you to work through an intro python course, such as [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/pythonforbeginnersintro/), or the [Day 1 materials](https://github.com/zashwood/pni_bootcamp_2019/tree/master/day01) from last summer's bootcamp.\n",
