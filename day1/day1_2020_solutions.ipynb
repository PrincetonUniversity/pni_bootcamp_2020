    "\n",
    "Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "* generate a 4D array that holds 500, 48x48 random RGB images (think about the shape this array should have, and use np.random.rand liberally)\n",

    "#### Comment on the array shape\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus for a moment on a single RGB image (which will be a 3D array). There's a question (with no cut-and-dry correct answer) about which of two shapes feels more natural for this structure.  Let's compare two candidates (48,48,3) vs (3,48,48)  (I think we can all agree that (48,3,48) is unnatural and weird for a host of reasons, but chime in if you think we're mistaken about that).\n",
    "\n",
    "**(48,48,3)** -- this shape lends itself to thinking about a single 48x48 object (the image as you'd probably view it, namely as a 48x48 square of pixels), with a trio of numbers (the R, G, and B intensities) stored on each pixel.  This is also the shape that the exercise suggested.  But you'd be perfectly within your rights to instead opt for...\n",
    "\n",
    "**(3,48,48)** -- this shape instead lends itself to conceiving of this as 3 \"channels\" at top level (i.e. axis0 level) -- a Red channel, a Green, and a Blue -- and that associated with each channel is a 48x48 image.  This view might feel more natural if you want to think in terms of \"color filters\", and thinking of each image as really being 3 separate images (one Red, one Green, one Blue) that you'd overlay to make the composite image.\n",
    "\n",
    "So which view is \"correct\"?  Or \"better\"?  Again, no right answer to this.  It really depends on how you want to conceptualize the composite image and on which shape will make slicing easier on your cognitively given the tasks you want to perform with these images.  The answers show things both ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Either way, it's probably most natural to have the N=500 axis *pre*pended to that shape -- so (500,48,48,3) or (500,3,48,48).  That makes it natural to conceptualize this (again, if we tend to think in axis0-first order) as 500 versions of whichever of the two shapes above you opted for."
