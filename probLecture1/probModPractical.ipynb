Often times from an experiment, if we continue with the example above, we will have $k$, the number of spikes. For the sake of this tutorial we'll say we somehow have $\\lambda$, the rate parameter. How do we then compute $P(X)$ for the $k, \\lambda$ that we have? We plug it in. Let's do this in code: "
